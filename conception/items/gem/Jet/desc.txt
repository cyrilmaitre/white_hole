Name:	Jet
Derivation:	From "Jaiet" (Old French) via Latin from Gagas, a town in Lydia, where it was found
Description:	Black, shiny and very light. In fact, it looks like black plastic! When you rub it on a hard white stone, you get a brown mark, or "streak". This is a good way to tell jet from sea coal (which would make a black mark).
