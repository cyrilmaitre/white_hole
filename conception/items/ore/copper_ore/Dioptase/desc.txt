Name:	Dioptase
Derivation:	From "dia" & "optazein" (Greek) to see through
Formula:	CuSiO2(OH)2
Description:	Dioptase has brilliant green transparent crystals. We found this stone hard to photograph. It is a far more vivid green than this. The grey part round the back is a piece of rock where the crystals grow, called the "matrix".
